# musicfromtheatom
An musical experiment using Tone.js and p5.js. This was my Master's project in University. I built a Cloud Chamber, which is a subatomic article detector, with my bare hands.
I then recorded a long video of particles decaying the chamber. They leave faint trails in the vapour, much like airplanes do in the sky.
These trails were analysed using a computer vision system developed in Javascript with p5.js. Their position was mapped to a grid.

Precomposed melodies were then recorded and the piece is assembled by the particles appearing in the cloud chamber.
